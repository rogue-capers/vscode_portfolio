# College Surplus Sale 

## Introduction 

When I arrived to my local college's surplus sale shortly after they opened, I didn't see any instructions or signs to indicate how the sale was setup or how it worked. After wandering around the warehouse to get my bearings I had made the following observations: 

* There are 3 tables being staffed by employees and two people wearing high visability vests and carrying clip boards
* Some shelving racks have a sign indicating the items must be bid on, but most items don't have bid numbers
* Some items do not have any signage, bid numbers, or price tags 

The first table had two employees with a laptop and people lined up with bid sheets. The second table was a standard cash register. And the last table was on a raised platform and seemed to be an observation point for loss prevention. 

It was at the second table, the cash register, where I found the following instruction sheet.
