# Microscopy 

While there are plentiful resources on the theory or use of microscopes, it is difficult to find a cohesive structure of information that offers the user multiple pathways to align with their learning preferences or desired goals. 

Here we apply the principles of Diataxis to create a systematic approach to the structure of microscopy instruction to meet the user's needs. 

## Needs = Structure 
Diataxis divides user's needs into four categories (Action, Cognition, Acquire, & Apply) and addresses where these needs intersect with four types of documentation (Tutorial, Explanation, How-to, & Reference):


 |  | Action | Cognition | 
 | --- | :--------: | :-----------: |
 | **Acquire** | Tutorial | Explanation |
 | **Apply** | How-to | Reference |

### Tutorials 
> Acquire & Action 

A learning experience where users acquire skills by actions they take. 

### How-to Guides 
> Apply & Action  

A practical guide where users apply skills to complete specific actions. 

### Reference 
> Cognition & Apply 

Theoretical knowledge that users can apply to a goal. 

### Explanation 
> Cognition & Acquire

Theoretical knowledge for users to acquire context.
