Hi, I'm Jake Hutchison.

 I'm a technical writer with experience in highly regulated, fast-moving, impactful industries. I am passionate about combining technical data, SME input, client input, and user feedback within a regulated environment into concise and effective production documentation. 

 My professional technical writing experience has been in  [human health & science](Resume.md#experience). I balance that experience with [mechanical and other personal projects](Portfolio/index.md#portfolio). When I'm not writing, you'll find me practicing one of my [exploration disciplines](Personal.md#personal). 

 If you have any questions or would like to talk more please feel free to [reach out](Contact.md#contact)!
